About the Team
Data is deeply embedded in the product and engineering culture at Tesla.

We collect data from each of our cars, Superchargers, and energy storage devices to make these products better and our customers safer.  

The Fleet Analytics team is a central team that helps many teams leverage the data we collect. We help engineers through direct support by doing data analysis for them and through applications and tools so they can self-serve those analyses in the future. To do so, we leverage our internal data platform built on top of AWS, S3, Spark, Trino using open source data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, Bokeh, Superset, and Airflow. Our work has a direct impact on Tesla's product, and enables the work of hundreds of engineers across disciplines throughout the company.

* Write reproducible data analysis over petabytes of data using cutting-edge open source technologies
* Summarize and clearly communicate data analysis assumptions and results
* Build data pipelines to promote your ad-hoc data analyses into production dashboards that engineers can rely on
* Design and implement metrics, applications and tools that will enable engineers by allowing them to self-serve their data insights
* Work with engineers to drive usage of your applications and tools
* Write clean and tested code that can be maintained and extended by other software engineers

What You’ll Bring* Strong proficiency in Python, SQL
* Able to understand electrical systems

Pendulum® is leading a revolution that is occurring around the world to improve physical and mental health by first understanding, then restoring and enhancing the human microbiome.  

Studies have shown that our microbiome (the bacterial communities in and on our bodies) is linked to everything from metabolism and diabetes, to longevity, weight loss, healthy immune systems, cancer prevention, feelings of well-being, inflammatory bowel disease, and even healthy skin. We have just scratched the surface on understanding the impact that our microbiome has on our lives. During early life we develop a diverse and balanced microbiome that plays a critical role in shaping our long-term health. Over our lives, a combination of diet, lifestyle, antibiotics, and aging can decrease the effectiveness of our microbiome.  

Pendulum recognized the enormous impact they could have on people’s lives if they were able to address the imbalances in the microbiome. To accomplish this, Pendulum created proprietary probiotic pipelines and a unique discovery platform to identify key, novel bacterial strains and the prebiotics that feed them. The company has also built and developed the world’s first manufacturing technology to produce bacteria in an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment at scale.  

The medical probiotics that Pendulum has formulated have transformed the consumer probiotics market into a new category of therapeutic offerings that deliver the power and efficacy of a pharmaceutical with the safety and accessibility of a natural probiotic. Due to Pendulum’s explosive revenue and customer growth over the last two years, the company earned a spot on Forbes Magazine’s exclusive “The Next Billion Dollar Startups” list.

This role falls within the broader AWS Infrastructure Services (AIS) organization, which owns the design, planning, delivery, and operation of all AWS global infrastructure.

We support all AWS data centers and all the servers, storage, networking, power, and cooling equipment that ensure our customers have continual access to the innovation they rely on. We work on the most challenging problems, with thousands of variables impacting the supply chain — and we’re looking for talented people who want to help.

AWS values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all the preferred qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn’t followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don’t let it stop you from applying.
  
  

We value work-life harmony. Achieving success at work should never come at the expense of sacrifices at home, which is why we strive for flexibility as part of our working culture. When we feel supported in the workplace and at home, there’s nothing we can’t achieve in the cloud.
  
  

Here at AWS, it’s in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences. Ongoing events and learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences, inspire us to never stop embracing our uniqueness.
  
  

We’re continuously raising our performance bar as we strive to become Earth’s Best Employer. That’s why you’ll find endless knowledge-sharing, mentorship, and other career-advancing resources here to help you develop into a better-rounded professional.
