## Project Overview
This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project aims to integrate data from multiple sources, process it efficiently, and store it in optimized databases for analysis and machine learning applications. The project leverages various technologies to create a robust, scalable, and automated data pipeline.

## Architecture
The project uses a containerized architecture with Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment. This approach allows for easy scaling and management of the various components in the ETL pipeline.

## Technologies Used

### Docker
**Why:** Docker provides a consistent environment for development, testing, and production. It encapsulates the application and its dependencies, making it easier to deploy and scale the ETL pipeline across different systems.

### Apache Airflow
**Why:** Airflow is used for orchestrating the ETL workflow. It offers:
- Task scheduling and dependency management
- Easy monitoring and error handling
- Extensibility through custom operators and hooks
- A web interface for managing and monitoring workflows

### PySpark
**Why:** PySpark is chosen over Hadoop for data processing due to:
- In-memory processing, leading to faster computations
- A more user-friendly API compared to Hadoop MapReduce
- Better integration with Python libraries and machine learning tools
- Support for both batch and stream processing
- Efficient handling of large-scale datasets

### Python
**Why:** Python is used for web scraping and general scripting due to its:
- Rich ecosystem of libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy for web scraping)
- Ease of use and readability
- Strong integration with data processing and machine learning libraries

### PostgreSQL (Staging Database)
**Why:** PostgreSQL is used as a staging database because:
- It handles heavy write operations efficiently
- It provides strong data integrity and ACID compliance
- It offers advanced features like JSON support and full-text search
- It has good performance for both read and write operations

### MariaDB (OLAP Database)
**Why:** MariaDB is chosen as the OLAP database due to its:
- Columnar storage capabilities, which improve query performance for analytical workloads
- Better data compression, reducing storage requirements
- Compatibility with MySQL, allowing for easy migration if needed
- Open-source nature and active community support

### Pandas
**Why:** Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis because:
- It provides powerful data structures like DataFrames
- It offers a wide range of built-in functions for data cleaning and transformation
- It integrates well with other Python libraries and databases

### Power BI
**Why:** Power BI is used for creating dashboards and visualizations because:
- It offers a user-friendly interface for creating interactive visualizations
- It can connect directly to various data sources, including MariaDB
- It provides real-time data refresh capabilities
- It allows for easy sharing and collaboration on dashboards

## Data Sources
The project collects data from multiple sources in various formats:
- JSON files
- CSV files
- Parquet files
- Web scraping (using custom Python scripts)

## ETL Process

### Extraction
PySpark is used for data extraction due to its distributed processing capabilities and unified API for handling various data formats.

### Transformation
The transformation process includes:
- Data cleaning using PySpark
- Merging data into a single DataFrame
- Schema inference and validation

### Loading
Data is loaded into two database systems:
1. PostgreSQL for staging
2. MariaDB for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

## Database Systems

### PostgreSQL (Staging Database)
PostgreSQL is optimized for heavy write operations and includes:
- Schema control and overwriting capabilities
- An archiving mechanism for old data
- Timestamp tracking for data loading

### MariaDB (OLAP Database)
MariaDB is configured with:
- Columnar storage for improved analytical query performance
- A star schema model for efficient OLAP operations

## Optimization Techniques
- Increased buffer pool size in PostgreSQL for better write performance
- Utilization of columnar storage in MariaDB for faster analytical queries
- PySpark's distributed computing for efficient data processing
